# Adaptive-Layout

This is the layout of a small website on which various solutions have been applied to improve user experience, such as:

1. Interactive form for filling out information
2. An adaptive version of the site for different screen sizes, including for mobile devices, and a burger is also made for the convenience of accessing the site menu on a smartphone.
